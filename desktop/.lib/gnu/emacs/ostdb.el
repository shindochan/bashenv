;;; --------------------
;;; (gdb) set args foo bar
;;; Breakpoint 1 at 0x92: file make-docfile.c, line 49.
;;; (gdb) -!-
;;; --------------------
;;; Essentially, the old prompt is deleted, and the command's output
;;; and the new prompt take its place.
;;;
;;; Not echoing the command is easy enough; you send it directly using
;;; process-send-string, and it never enters the buffer.  However,
;;; getting rid of the old prompt is trickier; you don't want to do it
;;; when you send the command, since that will result in an annoying
;;; flicker as the prompt is deleted, redisplay occurs while Emacs
;;; waits for a response from the debugger, and the new prompt is
;;; inserted.  Instead, we'll wait until we actually get some output
;;; from the subprocess before we delete the prompt.  If the command
;;; produced no output other than a new prompt, that prompt will most
;;; likely be in the first chunk of output received, so we will delete
;;; the prompt and then replace it with an identical one.  If the
;;; command produces output, the prompt is moving anyway, so the
;;; flicker won't be annoying.
;;;
;;; So - when we want to delete the prompt upon receipt of the next
;;; chunk of debugger output, we position gud-delete-prompt-marker at
;;; the start of the prompt; the process filter will notice this, and
;;; delete all text between it and the process output marker.  If
;;; gud-delete-prompt-marker points nowhere, we leave the current
;;; prompt alone.

(defun gud-mode ()
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior debugger process.

   You start it up with one of the commands M-x gdb, M-x sdb, M-x dbx,
or M-x xdb.  Each entry point finishes by executing a hook; `gdb-mode-hook',
`sdb-mode-hook', `dbx-mode-hook' or `xdb-mode-hook' respectively.

After startup, the following commands are available in both the GUD
interaction buffer and any source buffer GUD visits due to a breakpoint stop
or step operation:

\\[gud-break] sets a breakpoint at the current file and line.  In the
GUD buffer, the current file and line are those of the last breakpoint or
step.  In a source buffer, they are the buffer's file and current line.

\\[gud-remove] removes breakpoints on the current file and line.

\\[gud-refresh] displays in the source window the last line referred to
in the gud buffer.

\\[gud-step], \\[gud-next], and \\[gud-stepi] do a step-one-line,
step-one-line (not entering function calls), and step-one-instruction
and then update the source window with the current file and position.
\\[gud-cont] continues execution.

\\[gud-print] tries to find the largest C lvalue or function-call expression
around point, and sends it to the debugger for value display.

The above commands are common to all supported debuggers except xdb which
does not support stepping instructions.

Under gdb, sdb and xdb, \\[gud-tbreak] behaves exactly like \\[gud-break],
except that the breakpoint is temporary; that is, it is removed when
execution stops on it.

Under gdb, dbx, and xdb, \\[gud-up] pops up through an enclosing stack
frame.  \\[gud-down] drops back down through one.

If you are using gdb or xdb, \\[gud-finish] runs execution to the return from
the current function and stops.

All the keystrokes above are accessible in the GUD buffer
with the prefix C-c, and in all buffers through the prefix C-x C-a.

All pre-defined functions for which the concept make sense repeat
themselves the appropriate number of times if you give a prefix
argument.

You may use the `gud-def' macro in the initialization hook to define other
commands.

Other commands for interacting with the debugger process are inherited from
comint mode, which see."
